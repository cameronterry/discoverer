Discoverer
==========

The WordPress theme which enables you the power of discovery for your visitors.

This theme comes with a special power; when creating Posts using "Link" format it'll work
exactly like the [Video Thumbnails](https://refactored.co/plugins/video-thumbnails) plugin.

It'll take the first URL inside the post body and then will go and get the OpenGraph tag
data to retrieve the thumbnail.
